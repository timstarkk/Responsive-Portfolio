            <p id="paragraph">My name is Tim Stark. I am from Baytown, Texas, a chemical plant/refinery town just east of Houston.
                As a kid, I always enjoyed drawing, and playing video games. When I was a kid, and someone asked what I wanted to do when I got older,
                I always told them I wanted to be a game designer. Not knowing what that entailed. <br><br> 
                As I got older, I kept gaming, and that kept me interested in technology, (building my own PC, etc.) I also got into music, playing guitar and drums in high school
                and after that I taught myself how to produce rap beats. I also began teaching myself how to code. I have some pretty big dreams for life, but have been sort of all over the place, not picking one skill to master. As a lyft driver, 
                I fell into conversation with a developer for Indeed who encouraged me to pick one skill, and dive in head first.<br><br>
                About two months ago, I found out my girlfriend is pregnant. (Her name is Sabryna, she is in the picture with me above.) 
                When I heard the news, and pondered my next moves, the words of the Indeed developer came to my mind. In order to accelerate my career, and increase my finances in preparation for my first child, I have enrolled in this boot camp in order to secure a job as a developer.
